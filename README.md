## Installation and Run Locally

To begin working with this project, follow these steps:

1. Install Node.js and XAMPP:

- Ensure Node.js is installed on your machine. You can download it from nodejs.org.
- Install XAMPP to set up your MySQL database. You can download it from apachefriends.org.
2. Open Your Project:

- Use an IDE like VS Code to open your project files.
3. Initialize the Project:

- Open your IDE and navigate to the project directory in the terminal.
- Run npm init -y to initialize a package.json file with default options.
4. Install Dependencies:

- Run the following command to install project dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
5. Start the Server:

- Start your Node.js server. If you're using index.js as your main server file, run:
```
nodemon index.js
```
This assumes you have nodemon installed globally (npm install -g nodemon). Alternatively, use node index.js to start without nodemon.

6. Connect to the Database:

- Ensure XAMPP is running and MySQL is active.
- Configure your database connection in your Node.js application (e.g., using mysql or sequelize packages).
7. Test Your Application:

- Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:your_port to see your application running.
